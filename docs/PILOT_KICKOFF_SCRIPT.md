# Pilot Kickoff Script

## Opening framing
Hermes is a neutral decision layer that narrows options by explaining differences. It does not rank, recommend, or persuade.

## Non-negotiables (restated)
- No ranking or recommendations
- Max-3 options
- Single-store sessions only
- Honesty window always visible
- Proof mode only in non-production environments

## Introducing Proof UI vs Reference UI
- Proof UI: use when stakeholders need auditability and decision trace inspection.
- Reference UI: use to show the neutral customer-facing flow.

## Setting expectations about feedback
We accept feedback that clarifies or corrects existing behavior. Requests to change decision behavior are not accepted.

## Closing alignment check
"If this no longer fits your operating principles, we stop the pilot."
