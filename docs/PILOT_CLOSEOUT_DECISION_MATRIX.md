# Pilot Closeout Decision Matrix

Decisions must be evidence-based. Gut feel is not allowed.

## Continue
- Why: trust signals are positive and scope remains stable.
- Required evidence:
  - Documented acceptance of non-ranking and max-3
  - Clear understanding of honesty window
  - No pressure to optimize or expand scope

## Expand
- Conditions (all required):
  - Pilot completed without invariant or scope violations
  - Stakeholders request continued use within the same principles
  - Explicit agreement that scope can expand only after a new contract
- Required evidence:
  - Written confirmation of principles
  - Review notes showing stable trust signals

## Stop
- Conditions:
  - Repeated requests for ranking or optimization
  - Attempts to remove honesty window
  - Pressure to expand scope mid-pilot
  - Loss of trust in neutrality
- Required evidence:
  - Observation notes or review entries documenting the condition

Stopping a pilot is a normal, acceptable outcome.
