# Conversation to Pilot Decision Tree

## Decision points
1) First reply sent with neutral overview and qualification questions.
2) Review responses for fit and constraints acceptance.

## Paths

### Not a fit
Conditions:
- Seeks recommendations, ranking, or optimization.
- Wants persuasion or conversion tactics.

Action:
- Send a calm refusal and close.

Suggested response:
"Hermes is a neutral honesty engine and does not recommend, rank, or optimize. Based on your goals, it is not a fit. If your needs change toward neutral, auditable narrowing, we can revisit."

### Education only
Conditions:
- No clear decision surface yet.
- General interest or research inquiry.

Action:
- Share public docs and end the loop unless new context appears.

### Potential pilot
Conditions:
- Clear decision surface.
- Accepts non-ranking, non-optimization behavior.
- Needs auditable proof and constraint-based narrowing.

Action:
- Offer a scoped pilot discussion with constraints and proof expectations.

## Proof UI vs Reference UI
- Proof UI is appropriate after fit is confirmed and the partner accepts deterministic, auditable behavior.
- Reference UI is appropriate when a partner needs a neutral example of explanations without product-specific data.

## When to end the conversation
- The partner requests ranking, optimization, or promotion.
- The partner rejects neutrality or auditable constraints.
- The decision surface cannot be identified after two exchanges.

## Refusal posture
- Keep refusals calm and factual.
- Do not debate or persuade.
- Offer to reconnect if their requirements change.
