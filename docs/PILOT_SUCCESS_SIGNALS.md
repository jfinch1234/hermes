- Reduced internal debate on how choices are presented.
- Clear articulation of differences in Hermes outputs.
- Explicit acceptance of non-ranking behavior.
- Evidence of repair loop usage when expectations are misaligned.

## Poor-fit signals
- Repeated requests for ranking or "best" labels.
- Attempts to expand scope or add new features mid-pilot.
- Pressure to optimize outcomes or run A/B tests.
- Refusal to accept honesty window visibility.

## Explicitly forbidden
- ROI claims
- lift metrics
- optimization language
