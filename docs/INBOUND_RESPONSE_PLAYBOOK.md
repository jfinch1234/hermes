Subject: Thanks for reaching out

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the note. Hermes is an honesty engine for decisions. It narrows options by meaningful differences and explicit constraints, and provides auditable proof for why options remain or are removed. Hermes does not recommend, rank, or optimize.

If you want a concise overview, the public docs index is here:
- PUBLIC_DOCS_INDEX.md

If it helps, a few short questions so we can confirm fit:
- What decisions would Hermes support in your product?
- Where does trust or neutrality matter most in those decisions?
- What would make Hermes a bad fit?
- Can you confirm you are not looking for ranking or optimization?

If you prefer, you can answer in a few bullets.

Best,
[Your Name]
