# Market Narrative & Category Definition

## The problem
Choices without clarity create two outcomes: manipulation or regret. When people cannot see meaningful differences, they hand control to systems that decide for them, or they guess and live with the cost. This erodes trust for users and for the organizations serving them.

## What is broken
Ranking, ads, and recommendations optimize outcomes, not trust. They seek a winner, push a preference, or steer a conversion. The result is a system that looks helpful while quietly shaping choices in ways users cannot verify.

## Hermes
Hermes is an exploratory honesty engine. It narrows by meaningful variation, not by preference. It helps users see why options differ, and it refuses to manufacture a best answer. The goal is clarity that a user can check.

## Proof
Hermes is deterministic, auditable, and protected by invariants. Given the same inputs and constraints, it produces the same outputs. Its decisions can be traced, inspected, and validated against explicit rules.

## Why now
Regulation is tightening, reputational risk is increasing, and user distrust is high. Systems that cannot explain their choices are becoming liabilities. Hermes provides a trustworthy way to narrow options without covert persuasion.
