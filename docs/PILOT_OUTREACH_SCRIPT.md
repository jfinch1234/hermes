# Pilot Outreach Script

## Cold / warm outreach message
Hi {Name},

Hermes is a neutral decision layer that narrows options by explaining real differences. It is designed for organizations where trust and inspectability matter more than conversion tactics.

We do not rank or recommend products, and we do not optimize for lift. The system is inspectable end-to-end in non-production environments.

If decision clarity and neutrality are core to how you operate, would that philosophy align with how you want to serve customers?
