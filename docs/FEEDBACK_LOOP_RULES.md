# Feedback Loop Rules

Hermes corrects misunderstandings, not outcomes.

## Allowed feedback
- bug reports
- clarity issues (wording, ambiguity)
- missing data
- correctness of facts

## Disallowed feedback
- ranking requests
- persuasion or emphasis requests
- highlighting or default selection requests
- optimization or conversion requests

## Evaluation test
1. Does the request change Hermes behavior? Reject.
2. Does the request clarify existing behavior? Consider.

## Standard rejection language
"Thanks for the feedback. Hermes does not rank, recommend, or optimize outcomes. We can only clarify existing behavior or correct factual errors. This request would change decision behavior, so we cannot accept it."
