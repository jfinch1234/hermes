# UI Guardrails

## Non-negotiable rules
- Symmetric options: each option gets the same layout and weight.
- No emphasis: avoid highlighting, ordering cues, or default selections.
- Honesty window is always visible alongside options.
- Refusal responses must redirect neutrally without policy arguments.

## Bad patterns (described)
- A large "primary" card and smaller secondary cards for other options.
- Labels such as "best", "top", "recommended", or "our pick".
- Auto-selected default option or pre-checked choice.
- Hiding honesty details behind a toggle or expanding only for one option.
- Adding a promotional ribbon or badge on a single option.
