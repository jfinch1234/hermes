# Category Definition: Decision Infrastructure / Honesty Engine

Hermes is Decision Infrastructure. It is an Honesty Engine that helps people explore choices with clarity. It narrows the field by meaningful differences and explicit constraints, while remaining neutral about preference.

## What Hermes is
- Decision Infrastructure that makes choices inspectable and verifiable.
- An Honesty Engine that exposes differences and explains why options remain or are removed.
- A neutral narrowing system based on constraints and explicit rules.

## What Hermes is not
Hermes is explicitly not:
- a recommendation engine
- a ranking system
- a marketplace optimizer
- an ad unit

## What buyers should expect
### Behavior
- Deterministic outputs given the same inputs and constraints.
- Auditable traces that show why each option is included or excluded.
- Neutral narrowing based on meaningful variation, not preference.
- Invariant-protected constraints that prevent covert optimization.

### UI expectations
- Explanations for differences, not a single "best" option.
- Clear constraint controls that the user can inspect and change.
- No language implying persuasion, optimization, or preference.
- Visibility into why options remain or are removed.
