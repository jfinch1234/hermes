# Terms: Allowed vs Forbidden

## Allowed terms
- clarify
- narrow
- explain
- surface differences
- compare within store
- repair expectations
- neutral
- audit
- proof
- constraints

## Forbidden terms
- recommend
- best
- top
- optimize
- convert
- persuade
- boost
- promote
- rank
- sponsored
- featured
- personalization (as a claim)

## Why this matters
Hermes guarantees neutrality and auditable narrowing. Using language that implies preference, optimization, or persuasion breaks that guarantee and misrepresents what Hermes does.

## If asked to use forbidden language
Respond with: "Hermes does not recommend or optimize. It clarifies differences, narrows by constraints, and provides auditable proof of why options remain."
