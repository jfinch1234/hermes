# Objection Handlers

## "Can you recommend the best one?"
We stay neutral so customers can trust the decision. If you share the key constraint that matters most, Hermes will narrow the options and explain the differences.

## "Can you show top 10?"
Hermes keeps the choice set small to preserve clarity and confidence. Tell us what you care about most and we will present a few clear options.

## "Can we pay to be featured?"
Hermes does not take paid placement because trust depends on neutrality. We can highlight meaningful differences so customers choose based on fit, not promotion.

## "Can you personalize based on past purchases?"
Hermes avoids personalization to keep decisions transparent and consistent. If you share your current needs, Hermes will narrow the choices and explain tradeoffs.

## "Can you compare stores?"
Hermes operates within one store per session to keep context consistent. If you select a store, Hermes will help you decide within that catalog.

## "Can you remove honesty window to speed conversion?"
The honesty window builds trust by explaining real differences. If speed is the concern, we can ask a single narrowing question to reduce the choice set quickly.
