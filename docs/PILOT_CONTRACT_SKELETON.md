# Pilot Contract Skeleton

## 1. Scope of License
The provider grants the customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable
license to use the Hermes evaluation service solely for the pilot period and
for the business units identified in the order form.

## 2. Non-Ranking Clause
The service does not produce ordering, scoring, or prioritization of products.
The customer shall not request, configure, or use the service to produce such
outputs.

## 3. Non-Persuasion Clause
The service provides neutral explanations of differences and does not include
persuasive or promotional language. The customer shall not instruct the service
to generate persuasive outputs.

## 4. Auditability Clause (Proof Mode)
When proof mode is enabled in non-production environments, the customer may
request a trace of decision steps for audit and verification. Proof mode is not
available in production.

## 5. Termination on Invariant Violation
If the provider determines that the service invariants are violated or that the
customer attempts to bypass them, the provider may immediately terminate the
pilot without liability.

## 6. Limitation of Customization
Enterprise policies are immutable and cannot be overridden or customized by the
customer, including but not limited to the option cap and single-store scope.
