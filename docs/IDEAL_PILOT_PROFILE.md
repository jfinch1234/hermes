# Ideal Pilot Profile

Hermes pilots are reserved for organizations that value trust and inspection over conversion gains.

## Ideal pilot characteristics
- Regulated or trust-sensitive domains
- Long buying cycles and high-consideration decisions
- Low tolerance for manipulation or promotional bias
- Enterprise or near-enterprise buyers with governance

## Explicitly non-ideal pilots
- Growth hackers
- Affiliate marketplaces
- Ad-driven platforms
- Conversion-optimized funnels

## Why now
Customers are more skeptical of opaque recommendation systems. Hermes offers neutral, inspectable decision support that reduces risk while preserving trust.
