## Headline
Hermes is an honesty engine for decisions.

## What Hermes is not
Hermes is not a recommendation engine, ranking system, marketplace optimizer, or ad unit.

## How it works
- Narrows options by meaningful variation and explicit constraints.
- Explains differences so users can compare within the store.
- Repairs expectations by showing why options remain or are removed.

## Why trust it
- Deterministic: same inputs and constraints produce the same output.
- Auditable: every inclusion or removal is traceable.
- Invariant-protected: rules prevent covert optimization.

## Who it is for
- Teams that must keep choice-making neutral and explainable.
- Products where trust depends on clarity, not persuasion.

## Who it is not for
- Teams seeking recommendations, rankings, or optimization.
- Products that depend on conversion tactics or preference shaping.
