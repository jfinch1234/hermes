# Expansion Refusal Playbook

## Optimization requests
We keep Hermes neutral and do not optimize for outcomes. We can clarify language, but we do not change decision behavior.

## Ranking expansion
Hermes does not rank or recommend. We can add a new flow within the same neutral rules, but ranking is out of scope.

## Monetization via placement
Paid placement conflicts with neutrality. We can expand to another store or flow, but we do not sell placement.

## "Just this one exception"
Hermes depends on consistent principles. We can consider a scoped expansion under the same rules, but exceptions are not allowed.
