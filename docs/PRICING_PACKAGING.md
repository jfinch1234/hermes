# Pricing and Packaging

## Positioning
Hermes is decision infrastructure, not a recommendation engine. It preserves neutrality and clarity by surfacing meaningful differences within a single-store context.

## Definitions
- Store: A single retail or catalog environment with its own products and policies.
- Session: A user interaction thread scoped to one store.
- Adapter: The catalog integration that supplies product facts to Hermes.
- Proof mode: A non-production trace of decision steps for audit and verification.
- Single-store context: Hermes operates within one store per session and does not compare across stores.

## Tiers
