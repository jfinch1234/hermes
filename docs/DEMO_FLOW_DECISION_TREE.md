# Demo Flow Decision Tree

## Do not demo if
- The prospect asks for ranking, recommendations, or optimization
- The prospect wants conversion lift guarantees
- The prospect insists on paid placement or sponsorship
- The prospect refuses auditability or proof mode

## Show Proof UI first when
- The prospect is risk-averse or regulated
- The prospect wants audit trails and inspection
- The prospect asks how decisions are made

## Show Reference UI when
- The prospect accepts non-ranking and max-3 upfront
- The prospect wants to see a neutral customer flow

## Required questions before any demo
- Do you accept non-ranking and no recommendations?
- Do you accept a max-3 option cap?
- Do you accept single-store sessions?
- Are you comfortable with audit visibility in dev/staging?

## Red flags that stop the demo immediately
- "Can we show top 10?"
- "Can you highlight the best?"
- "Can we pay to be featured?"
- "Can you optimize for conversion?"
- "We need this to pick winners"
