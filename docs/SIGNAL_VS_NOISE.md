# Signal vs Noise

## Signal examples
- Explicit acceptance of non-ranking and max-3
- Reduced internal debate about how to present choices
- Trust statements about neutrality or auditability
- Clear articulation of differences without prompting

## Noise examples
- Feature requests outside scope
- UI opinions or aesthetic preferences
- Optimization or conversion suggestions
- Requests for ranking, highlighting, or default selection

## Rules for ignoring noise
- Acknowledge once, then decline without debate.
- Re-center on Hermes principles and scope.
- Do not open backlog items for noise.
