# Live Refusal Responses

## "Can we tweak this just for now?"
We keep the pilot consistent with Hermes principles. We can adjust wording for clarity, but we do not change decision behavior.

## "Can you hide this explanation?"
The honesty window is required. We can simplify the wording, but it stays visible.

## "Can we highlight one option?"
We present options symmetrically. We can clarify differences, but we do not highlight or prioritize.

## "Can we test this variant?"
We do not run A/B tests during pilots. We can review clarity issues, but we do not optimize outcomes.
